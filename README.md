This application was a test of my use of NodeJS's fs package and inquirer. This application takes in user input from the command line and generates an HTML page using fs. The application also demonstrates my ability to functionally use Jest in Test Driven Development for application deployment.

## Dependencies

This application uses the following to deploy and run:  
-NodeJS

This application was tested with Jest.
